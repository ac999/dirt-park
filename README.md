Documentation / Research / Plans for building a Dirt Park in Iasi

## Chat-GPT 3.5 Prompt Input:
```
I would like to create a dirt park for dirt jumping mountainbkes.

At the very beginning of the park it will be designated for two types of riding levels:
- Beginner friendly - a pumptrack, where people could learn the basic and jumping;
- Intermediate level - a jump line, where people that already know how to jump can learn air control and performing tricks.
Later, new lines could be added as people from the community start to progress and new needs start to appear.

This project must not be financed from own pocket.

It would be great if the terrain is on public property, given by the City Hall.

What are the full steps to create the dirtpark, from this idea to actually materializing it?
Give as much info as possible, with details such as what a good surface size should be, what kind of terrain, what kind of papers are needed, where to get finance, etc.

Creating a dirt park for dirt jumping mountain bikes is an exciting project! To bring this idea to fruition without financing it from your own pocket, it's important to follow a well-structured plan and engage with the community and local authorities. Here's a comprehensive guide on the steps to create the dirt park:
#### 1. Idea Conceptualization:
* Define the park's goals and objectives, including catering to both beginner and intermediate riders.
* Determine the ideal location within the community for the dirt park.
* Documented [here](./IDEA_CONCEPTUALIZATION.md).
#### 2. Location Scouting
* Look for public land that could potentially be used for the dirt park. Engage with the City Hall to discuss the possibility of using the land and obtaining necessary permissions.
#### 3. Community Engagement
* Present your idea to the local cycling community, seeking their input and support.
* Organize meetings or workshops to gather ideas and feedback on the layout and features of the park.
#### 4. Feasibility Study
* Assess the feasibility of the proposed location in terms of accessibility, environmental impact, and potential conflicts with existing land uses.
* Determine the suitable size of the park based on the available land and the intended level of use.
#### 5. Design and Planning
* Collaborate with professional trail designers who specialize in building dirt jump parks.
* Develop detailed plans for both the beginner pumptrack and the intermediate jump line, including layout, jump heights, spacing, and material specifications.
* The pumptrack should include berms, rollers, and small jumps for skill development. The jump line should feature progressively larger jumps for intermediate riders.
#### 6. Regulatory Approvals
* Obtain all necessary permits and approvals from local authorities and the City Hall. This may involve environmental assessments, zoning approvals, and land use permissions.
#### 7. Funding
* Seek financial support from various sources:
  - Contact local businesses, bike shops, and cycling clubs for sponsorships and donations.
  - Explore crowdfunding platforms to gather funds from the community.
  - Apply for grants from local government programs that support community projects.
#### 8. Construction
* Hire experienced trail builders or work with volunteers who have expertise in building dirt jump features.
* Start with the beginner pumptrack, ensuring it is safe and well-constructed, followed by the intermediate jump line.
#### 9. Safety and Maintenance
* Implement safety measures such as signage, helmets requirements, and guidelines for park use.
* Establish a maintenance plan to regularly inspect and repair the park to ensure rider safety.
#### 10. Promotion and Opening
* Organize an opening event to showcase the completed park to the community.
* Use social media, local events, and cycling networks to promote the park's availability.
#### 11. Community Involvement and Expansion
* Encourage riders to provide feedback and suggestions for improvements.
* As riders progress, consider adding new lines and features to accommodate their evolving skill levels
